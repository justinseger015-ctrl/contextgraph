//! End-to-End Causal Provenance Benchmark
//!
//! Comprehensive benchmark that tests the full provenance tracking pipeline:
//! 1. LLM extraction with source span generation (GBNF grammar)
//! 2. Source span accuracy validation
//! 3. CausalRelationship storage with provenance
//! 4. MCP search_causal_relationships provenance display
//! 5. E5 dual embedding asymmetric search quality
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Full benchmark with real LLM and embeddings:
//! cargo run -p context-graph-benchmark --bin causal-provenance-e2e-bench --release \
//!     --features real-embeddings -- --num-documents 20 --iterations 3
//!
//! # Quick smoke test:
//! cargo run -p context-graph-benchmark --bin causal-provenance-e2e-bench --release \
//!     --features real-embeddings -- --num-documents 5 --quick
//! ```
//!
//! ## Metrics Collected
//!
//! ### Phase 1: LLM Extraction Quality
//! - `extraction_success_rate`: % of documents with extracted relationships
//! - `avg_relationships_per_doc`: Average relationships found per document
//! - `avg_confidence`: Average LLM confidence score
//! - `avg_extraction_time_ms`: Extraction latency
//!
//! ### Phase 2: Source Span Accuracy
//! - `span_populated_rate`: % of relationships with source_spans
//! - `span_offset_valid_rate`: % of spans with valid character offsets
//! - `span_text_match_rate`: % of spans where excerpt matches source
//! - `span_type_distribution`: Distribution of cause/effect/full spans
//!
//! ### Phase 3: Storage Verification
//! - `causal_store_success_rate`: % of relationships stored successfully
//! - `provenance_chain_complete_rate`: % with full provenance chain
//! - `e5_dual_embedding_rate`: % with both cause and effect embeddings
//!
//! ### Phase 4: MCP Search Quality
//! - `search_precision_at_5`: Precision of top-5 results
//! - `provenance_display_rate`: % of results with provenance displayed
//! - `asymmetric_boost_effectiveness`: Improvement from E5 asymmetric search
//!
