//! Phase 6: End-to-End Causal Pipeline Benchmarks
//!
//! Tests the complete causal system pipeline:
//! - 6.1: Full Pipeline (LLM → E5 → Storage → Retrieval) [requires real-embeddings]
//! - 6.2: Domain Transfer (marker detection + asymmetric similarity across 10 domains)
//! - 6.3: Adversarial Robustness (edge cases that should NOT trigger causal detection)
//!
//! Run without GPU features:
//!   cargo run -p context-graph-benchmark --bin causal-e2e-bench --release
//!
//! Run with GPU features:
//!   cargo run -p context-graph-benchmark --bin causal-e2e-bench --release --features real-embeddings
