//! Causal Accuracy Benchmark
//!
//! Implements Phases 1.1, 1.2, 3.4, 4.1, and 4.2 from the E5 Causal Embedder
//! Benchmarking Plan. Uses REAL GPU embeddings (requires `real-embeddings` feature)
//! for Phase 1.1; Phases 1.2, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 are pure-code tests that always run.
//!
//! # Phases
//!
//! - **1.1 Vector Distinctness**: Cosine distance between cause/effect vectors per category
//! - **1.2 Marker Detection**: Precision/recall/F1 for `detect_causal_query_intent()`
//! - **3.4 Query Intent Detection**: 3-class accuracy on 100 labeled queries
//! - **4.1 Direction Modifier Sweep**: Asymmetric similarity across 11 modifier pairs
//! - **4.2 Per-Mechanism Modifiers**: Optimal modifier per causal mechanism type
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Full run (requires GPU for Phase 1.1):
//! cargo run -p context-graph-benchmark --bin causal-accuracy-bench \
//!     --release --features real-embeddings
//!
//! # Without GPU (skips Phase 1.1):
//! cargo run -p context-graph-benchmark --bin causal-accuracy-bench --release
//! ```
